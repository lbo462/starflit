*A single Strandbeest*

## **Project Principle**

Our fleet of robots is designed to operate in unknown and hazardous environments, where human rescue teams cannot operate.
Their mission consists in:

- **Exploring**: explore an unknown environment while avoiding collisions.
- **Detecting**: use the camera and AI to identify the presence of victims.
- **Locating**: determine the position of the victims.
- **Rescuing**: relay information to the rescue teams.

## **Documentation**

**All the documentation you will need is in the folder *docs/* or on our [Github Pages](https://lbo462.github.io/starflit/)ðŸš€**
