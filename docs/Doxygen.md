# Generating the documentation

Here, we use the famously know __Doxygen__ to generate out documentation.

To use it properly, install it for your OS by following the instruction on their [website](https://www.doxygen.nl/i).
Then, use the `Doxyfile` file to generate the documentation.

> On Linux, call `doxygen Doxyfile` at the root of this project.

It will create / update the folder called `docs/` that will contain the generated doc.
Open `docs/html/index.html` in your browser to read through it.
