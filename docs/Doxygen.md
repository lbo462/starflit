# Generating the documentation

Here, we use the famously know [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl) to generate the documentation.
In addition, we use [doxygen-awesome](https://jothepro.github.io/doxygen-awesome-css/) for the styling,
and __Github Actions__ to upload the documentation on Github Pages.

To use Doxygen locally, install it for your OS by following the instruction on their [website](https://www.doxygen.nl/i).

In order to generate the graphs as well, one should have the `dot` command available.
For that purpose, install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) and make sure it's reachable before you call Doxygen.

Then, use the `Doxyfile` file to generate the documentation.

> On Linux, call `doxygen Doxyfile` at the root of this project.

It will create / update the folder `docs/html` that will contain the generated doc.
Open `docs/html/index.html` in your browser to read through it.

> The folder `docs/html` is ignored by git and should stay that way.
> Instead, the doc is generated through Github Actions and deployed on [Github Pages](https://lbo462.github.io/starflit/).
> See the file `.github/workflows/static.yml` to explore the deeps of the job doing this magic trick.

## About the pythonic doc

Doxygen doesn't really seem to have been designed for Python.
The documentation it provides is not exhaustive and one might want to look directly inside the code to check all the written comments.

If a bored soul's reading this, note that [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) is a nicer solution to generate the Python documentation,
and that there exist [Breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/) to combine the documentation generated by Doxygen and Sphinx.

Here, we made the choice not to implement such a solution for the sake of the simplicity of this project, but you are free to do so.
