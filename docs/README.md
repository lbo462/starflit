# The Strandbeest fleet

- Github repository at [https://github.com/lbo462/starflit](https://github.com/lbo462/starflit).
- Documentation Pages at [https://lbo462.github.io/starflit](https://lbo462.github.io/starflit).

This project aims to automate a fleet of Strandbeest-like robots.

_Inspiration from [https://www.strandbeest.com/](https://www.strandbeest.com/)_.

Here lies all the documentation for the project.
You will find documentation for:

- the code (class structures, function definitions...)
- a more or less step by step summary of all the steps we went through for the development
- the electronic schematics of the robot
- the datasheets for the main components.

This documentation aims to be as exhaustive as possible so that whoever is interested will be able to build on this project seamlessly.

Have fun building üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è!
