# Docs index

Here lies all the documentation for the project.
You will find documentation for:

- the code (class structures, function definitions...)
- a more or less step by step summary of all the steps we went through for the development
- the electronic schematics of the robot
- the datasheets for the main components.

This documentation aims to be as exhaustive as possible so that whoever is interested will be able to build on this project seamlessly.
