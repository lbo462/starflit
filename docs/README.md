The starflit project aims to develop a fleet of autonomous robots capable of
locating and rescuing individuals in disaster-stricken areas.

The so called autonomous robots are strandbeest robot. You'll find a presentation of these robots from its creator at
[https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/~muller/Portfolio_SB.html](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/~muller/Portfolio_SB.html)

Here lies all the documentation for the starflit project.
You will find documentation for:

- the code (class structures, function definitions...)
- a more or less step by step summary of all the steps we went through
for the development : 
  - our objectives ;
  - our implementations ;
  - the problems we encountered ;
  - how to do things better 
- the electronic schematics of the robot
- the datasheets for the main components.

This documentation aims to be as exhaustive as possible so that whoever is interested will be able to build on this project seamlessly.

Have fun building 👷‍♂️👷‍♀️!

## How to read the doc ?

You're highly encouraged to read this documentation on
[GitHub Pages](https://lbo462.github.io/starflit), but you could also read
it on GitHub directly. If you're on GitHub, you should take a look at the
`docs/` folder where you'll find all the docs written in Markdown. They're
ordered by an index prefixing every filename, hence one should read them it
that order.

If you're reading this on GitHub Pages, you'll access to way more than this.
All the docs of the `docs/` are ordered and displayed in the sidebar, and one
should read them from top to bottom. The bonus, is that you also have access
to more sections about the code:
- __Modules__. Splits the different code sections in different modules we
defined. That's where you're encouraged to seek for any code-related doc, as
their were nicely ordered by hand.
- __File List__. List the documented files of the project. Allows searching 
any documentation for a given file.

## Resources

__Check the content of this folder in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lbo462/starflit/tree/master/docs/resources)__.

This folder contains:

- [datasheets](https://github.com/lbo462/starflit/tree/master/docs/resources/datasheets): All the datasheets of the hardware component we used.
- [schematics](https://github.com/lbo462/starflit/tree/master/docs/resources/shematics): The electronic schematics (in two parts) of the strandbeest robot as they were given to us.
